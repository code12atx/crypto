       <h1>File and Folder Encryption with TrueCrypt</h1>
          <h3><i>THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS</i></h3>
          <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This guide attempts to explain how to implement PGP email encryption to enhance security and privacy. This guide is a recipe, not an encyclopedia. Its primary goal is to demonstrate how it is done, not to explain why (although there is some explanation at the end). For further information, we recommend consulting the Ars Technica article on setting up email encryption. The Ars guide uses the same method described below, but we have no affiliation with Ars Technica. The article can be found <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/06/encrypted-e-mail-how-much-annoyance-will-you-tolerate-to-keep-the-nsa-away/">here at Ars Technica.</a></p>

          <p><strong>Software:</strong> The following software is used in this guide. For best security, always download the files from the original source and verify the checksum.</p>

              <h3 class="list-group-item-heading">TrueCrypt</h3>
              <p class="list-group-item-text">TrueCrypt is not necessary for email encryption, but it allows you to create encrypted “containers” that work like password-protected folders. You can fill these containers with the files you want to encrypt, and send them as email attachments as one way to encrypt attachments. You can also use them to keep your keys and personal data more secure on your own computer.</p>

          <h2>Nutshell</h2>
          <p>First, we are going to install Thunderbird. This will be your new way to access your existing email account (or you can create a new account if you'd like). If you have used an email program like Outlook, you should know what to expect.</p>

          <p>Second, we install a GPG key manager. GPG is an open source implementation of PGP encryption. This program will allow you to keep track of your Private Keys and all of your contacts' Public Keys. It will also allow you to create a key pair if you do not have one yet.</p>

          <p>Third, we will install Enigmail, an Add-On for Thunderbird that encrypts your emails using your keys. It works sort of like a bridge between Thunderbird and the key manager.</p>

          <p>Finally, we test it to make sure it works. I'll also outline how to use TrueCrypt to securely backup your private key and briefly mention a few other relevant topics.</p>

          <p>The Appendix has some general information on keys, keysigning, keyservers, and how TrueCrypt can come into play, as well as some suggestions for further reading.</p>


          <h2>Part I: Install Thunderbird</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Obtain the Thunderbird installation file
              <ul>
                <li>Visit <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird's site</a> and download the latest version
  ◦ or, install Thunderbird from the installation file on this CD</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Install Thunderbird
              <ul>
                <li>Double-click the installation file in your download folder or on the CD</li>
                <li>OS X – Drag Thunderbird to your Applications folder</li>
                <li>Windows – Allow the program to run and click Next until the installation program finishes. The standard options are okay.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Run Thunderbird
              <ul>
                <li>OS X – Double-click Thunderbird in your Applications folder</li>
                <li>Windows – Thunderbird should run after installation. If it does not, click the Start menu, select Programs or “All Programs”, and click Mozilla Thunderbird.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Configure Thunderbird to use your current email account
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Thunderbird should automatically begin to setup your email account. If it does not, click “Create a new account”
                  <ul>
                    <li>Click “Skip this and use my existing email” to setup Thunderbird using an email account you already have</li>
                    <li>Type your display name, current email address, and your email password and click “Continue”</li>
                    <li>If you typed your information correctly, you will now have the option to select between IMAP and POP3. Select IMAP if it is not already selected, and press “Done”. Your emails should begin to load. [Note: POP3 will work, but it may require additional configuration not covered in this guide.]</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Done! You can now access your email account using Thunderbird. You may want to customize the appearance of Thunderbird or enable other Add-Ons, but those topics are not covered in this guide. It may take some time to load all of your emails, but you should be able to continue with this guide in the meantime.</li>
          </ol>
